# EncryptCardTests
Acceptance Tests for EncryptCard Swift Package

This is separate repository from https://github.com/Lucra-Sports/EncryptCard 
 - to allow Swift Package Manager download package faster without large dependencies and extra files used by acceptance tests.
 - SPM requires package to Package.swift at the top level of the repo. See https://forums.swift.org/t/spm-multi-package-repositories/43193
